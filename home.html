        <p class="w3-text-grey">The drawing above is a depiction of the gas kitchen stovetop that I observed people using for this assignment. The main problem that it is trying to solve and its main function is that it simply offers an easy way for users to cook and heat food. This stovetop has four main burners, with two on each side, and one burner in the middle. Out of the four main burners, the two largest ones are located in the front of the stove, with the one on the left side being bigger, and the two in the back are smaller and are equal in size. Each of knobs corresponds to a specific burner, which is not labeled, and to start one a user must turn the knob to left. Also, grates cover most of the stovetop and each side is connected and lift up to allow users to clean the burner area. This stovetop is part of a unit that also includes a double oven, but for this assignment the observations and interviews were solely focused on the stovetop.</p>

        <h1 style="font-weight: bold;">User Observations</h1>
        <p>In addition to observing the users, to learn about the experiences each of the users had with the stovetop, I asked them a series of questions pertaining to different aspects of the appliance. Before interviewing the individuals, I asked them to try and answer the questions as accurately and honestly as possible and let them know that answers like “I didn’t know”, “I don’t recall”, or “No opinion” were perfectly acceptable answers to most questions and that they didn’t have to feel pressured to come up with an answer to any particular question. Throughout the interview, I also reminded them time to time about the ability to give these types of answers.</p>

        <h1 style="font-weight: bold;"> Interview Summaries</h1>
        <div class="interviewContainer">
            <div class="userRow" style="background:#3C6478;">
              <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">User 1</h2>
              <p>This individual is a very active user of the stovetop as they said they use it about once a day, which they said they mostly use it at lunch time to make the same meal, and said that it works as anticipated every time they use it. When picking which burner to use, since they tend to make the same thing for lunch every day they said that they typically start by using the front right burner because it is closest to the spices that they use for the meal and there is more counter space right next to that burner.  The user said that the knob placements were fine, though they would have liked if they were labeled since you wouldn’t have to remember what burner a particular knob corresponded to. Although the user said they did not have experience using the middle burner, they did have limited experience using all four main burners at once and commented that they found the stovetop tight in these situations and recall feeling very overwhelmed. One thing that was not important to this user was in regards to cleaning as they said that they rarely take the time to do it. Overall, this user gave the stovetop a 5 out of 6 in terms overall satisfaction but did not supply a justification for their rating.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="userRow" style="background:#1287A8;">
              <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">User 2</h2>
              <p>User 2 says that they use the stovetop multiple times a week and mostly uses it in the evening to make dinner, but does very seldom use it as lunch as well. Throughout their experiences using the stove, they found that it worked as anticipated most of the time as giving it a 5 out of 6 on this topic. In terms of some of the challenges they face, even though it works most of the time, they said that sometimes the burners don’t always ignite right away, which concerns them especially when they can then smell gas. The user has experience with both gas and electric stovetops and prefers the gas stovetops like the one they used because they find that electric stoves take too long to heat up and that once they do they find it gets too hot, which they said then causes them to burn everything. Obtaining the shortest cooking time was also extremely important for this user because they said that they need to cook quick since by the time to get home from work it is already pretty late, which why they said when picking which burner to use they typically just pick the largest one since it will cook the fastest. In regards to the placement of the knobs, they said they really don’t like it. They often forget which knobs turn on which burner, especially because they are not labeled, which causes them to often turn on the wrong burner. They also said that the burner placement just didn’t match with their expectations either, since they felt that the second knob from the left should be the front burner and the left most knob should correspond to the back burner. Another problem that they discussed with the stove was that they felt it could be bigger, especially when they were using all of the burners. Although they don’t cook with the four main burners often, they do have experience with it and said that they find it hectic and nerve racking because there is a lot going on at once so it’s easy to forget about something. They also said that they occasionally use the middle burner and that they were pretty satisfied with it, though they said that they found that you had to play around with the temperature since the flame wasn’t easily distributed. Having an easily cleanable stove was also very important to this user. Though they really liked that the grates could lift up for cleaning, they did say that they didn’t like that there were some stains or marks that they couldn’t get off no matter what they tried to do. Overall, they said that they are pretty satisfied with the stovetop, giving it a 5 out of 6, and referenced the knobs as one of the main reasons they couldn’t give it a perfect six. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="userRow" style="background:#93A661;">
              <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">User 3</h2>
              <p>User 3 is someone who says that they enjoy cooking and said that they use the stovetop multiple times a week, using it during the week mostly to cook dinner and then on weekends more to cook lunch. This user felt that the stove always performed as anticipated and having had experience with both gas and electric stoves, they said that they prefer gas stovetops because it is easier to control the heat. In regards to how they pick the burners, they said that they pretty much always start out with the two largest burners and that if they are cooking more than two things then they will use one of the back burners. However, they said that the back burners are too small and don’t get hot enough. Even though they typically use the largest burners, speeding up cooking time is not a reason for this as they said that that was not really a factor when deciding what burner to use. The reasoning they gave for this was because some things need more time to cook properly, such as they find that they need to turn the burners down in order to let simmer everything right. Some notable complaints that the user noted about the stovetop was in relation to the knobs, as they said they do not like the setup especially because they were left handed, and in terms of the amount of space on the stovetop as they preferred to have a bigger space since they didn’t feel they had enough room when making meals that required really big pots and pans. The user also said that they had lots of experience with using all four main burners at once, particularly during the holidays or when having to make multiple meals at the same time, and said that they were pretty dissatisfied with the stovetop in this situation, again bringing up the complaints about the back burners. They also said that they get easily frustrated when using the four burners at the same time since things can go easily wrong very quickly, which could then completely wreck a meal. Another part of the stove that the user said they had extensive experience with was the middle burner, which they were pretty neutral about it. They said it was beneficial since they could use the skillet on it, but they wished it could be hotter and found that they back heats up more than the front, which then requires him to have to turn the skillet in the middle of making something, such as pancakes, to make it cook more evenly. Though they use the stove multiple times a week, cleaning is not even close to a top priority for this user as they say they rarely clean it after using it. Overall, the user gave the stove a 4 out of 6 in terms of satisfaction, citing the small burners, lack of space, and the middle burner as to why it lost points.</p>

        <h2 style="padding-top: 2%;">Soccer Mom Martha</h2>
        <img src="soccermommarthaempathymap.png" style="width:95%">
        <h5>Soccer Mom Martha is a mother of two teenage boys, Michael and Matthew, and works a full time job. Unlike her husband, she does not enjoy cooking, but since he works evenings, she regularly has to make dinner. </h5>
        <p>The challenges she experiences with the stovetop are related to the placements of the knobs and cooking time. Since the knobs are unlabeled and not in the order that she intuitively expects them to be in, she often starts the wrong burner on accident. Also, because she works a full time job and has to frequently take her children to practice and other functions, she often finds that the stove doesn’t cook things quick enough, which stresses her out. </p>
        <p>Martha is a good representative of stovetop users in general because there are a lot of hard working parents who after long, tiring days at the office have to come home and make dinner for the family. Even if they aren’t taking their kids to soccer practice, people live extremely busy lives and so being able to cook something quick after work is something that a lot of people have to do on a daily basis.</p>
        <h2 style="padding-top: 2%;">Gourmet Gary</h2>
        <img src="gourmetgaryempathymap.png" style="width:95%">
        <h5>Gourmet Gary is a recent college graduate and one of his favorite hobbies is to cook a wide variety of meals for himself and his roommates. He also likes using recipes from social media or cook books to make dishes he has never had before.</h5>
        <p>Gary’s biggest challenges when it comes to the stovetop is related to the quality of the burners and the space available on the stovetop. He finds it difficult to cook with the back burners because they don’t get hot enough and finds it rather difficult to have enough space to do everything he needs to on the stovetop, especially when using all four burners at once.</p>
        <p>Especially while quarantining during the pandemic, cooking and trying lots of different dishes is an interest and something that a lot of people like to do. Therefore, since there are a large number of people who like to cook and try new meals, Gary is a good representative of stovetop users in general.</p>
