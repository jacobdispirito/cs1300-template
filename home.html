        <p class="w3-text-grey">The pictures and drawings above show the gas kitchen stovetop that I observed people using. The main problem that it is trying to solve and its main function is that it simply offers an easy way for users to cook and heat food. This stovetop has four main burners, with two on each side, and one burner in the middle. Out of the four main burners, the two largest ones are located in the front of the stove, with the one on the left side being bigger, and the two in the back are smaller and are equal in size. Each of knobs corresponds to a specific burner, which is not actually labeled on the stovetop, and to start one a user must turn the knob to left. Also, grates cover most of the stovetop and each side is connected and lift up to allow users to clean the burner area. This stovetop is part of a unit that also includes a double oven, but for this assignment the observations and interviews were solely focused on the stovetop.</p>

        <h1 style="font-weight: bold;">User Observations</h1>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">To gain more insight on how people use a stovetop, I observed three individuals at different times while they were using a stovetop to make a 
          specific meal for themselves or for others. I chose the three people I did because they varied in how much they liked to cook, their age, with one 
          being in their mid-twenties and the other two being middle aged, their jobs and responsibilities, their gender, and they all had prior experience 
          with quite a few different stovetops. Because of this, the users represents the general population of stovetop’s users pretty well, though to make the 
          observations more representative it would have been beneficial to observe someone with no experience using a stovetop as well as someone who 
          uses it more frequently.  </p>

        <h1 style="font-weight: bold;">Interview Questions</h1>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">In addition to observing the users, to learn about the experiences each of the users had with the stovetop, I asked them a series of questions 
          pertaining to different aspects of the appliance. Before interviewing the individuals, I asked them to try and answer the questions as 
          accurately and honestly as possible and let them know that answers like “I didn’t know”, “I don’t recall”, or “No opinion” were perfectly 
          acceptable answers to most questions and that they didn’t have to feel pressured to come up with an answer to any particular question. 
          Throughout the interview, I also reminded them time to time about the ability to give these types of answers.</p>

        <h1 style="font-weight: bold;"> Interview Summaries</h1>
        <div class="interviewContainer">
            <div class="userRow" style="background:#3C6478;">
              <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">User 1</h2>
              <p>Despite not having a particular strong liking of cooking (3 on a scale from 1-6), this individual is a very active user of the stovetop as they use it about once a day, mostly at lunch time and to make the same meal. This individual finds that the stove works for them most of the time and is happy that the stovetop is gas instead of electric. While using the stovetop, this individual typically starts by using the front right burner because it is closest to the spice cabinet and there is more counter space right next to that burner compared to the others. Although the user said that the ordering of the knobs and how they were placed was fine, they would have liked if they were labeled since it would eliminate the need to remember what burner a particular knob corresponds to. Similarly, another complaint that the user made about the stovetop pertained to the few times they used all four of the main burners at once since they found it was a little tight and recall feeling very overwhelmed in this situation. One aspect of the stovetop that was not important to this user was in regards to cleaning as they said that they rarely take the time to do it. Overall, this user gave the stovetop a 5 out of 6 in terms overall satisfaction but did not supply a justification for their rating. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="userRow" style="background:#1287A8;">
              <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">User 2</h2>
              <p>Although this user does not like cooking at all (gave it a 1 out of 6), User 2 says that they use the stovetop multiple times a week and mostly uses it in the evening to make dinner, but occasionally will use it at lunch as well. Throughout their experiences using the stove, they found that it worked as anticipated most of the time as giving it a 5 out of 6 on this topic. In terms of some of the challenges they face, even though it works most of the time, they said that sometimes the burners don’t always ignite right away, which concerns them especially when they can then smell gas immediately after. Despite this challenge related to igniting the gas, this user strongly prefers gas stovetops like the one they used because they find that electric stoves take too long to heat up and they get too hot, which they said then causes them to burn everything. Another challenge and complaint they have with the stovetop is related to the ordering and placements of the knobs. They often forget which knobs turn on which burner, especially because they are not labeled, which causes them to often turn on the wrong burner. They also said that the knob placement just didn’t match with their expectations either, since they felt that the second knob from the left should be the front burner and the left most knob should correspond to the back burner. Furthermore, another problem that they discussed with the stove was that they felt it could be bigger, especially when they were using all of the burners. Although they don’t cook with the four main burners often, they do have experience with it and said that they find it hectic and nerve racking because there is a lot going on at once so it’s easy to forget about something. One notable difference in User 2’s answers compared with the others was that they replied the most important aspect of the stove was safety, while the others talked about the ability to properly heat the food. While using the stovetop on a typical night to make dinner, obtaining the shortest cooking time was also extremely important for this user because they said that they need to cook quick since by the time to get home from work it is already pretty late, which why they said when picking which burner to use they typically just pick the largest one since it will cook the fastest. They also said that they occasionally use the middle burner and that they were pretty satisfied with it, though they said that they found that you had to play around with the temperature since the flame wasn’t evenly distributed. Having an easily cleanable stove was also very important to this user. Though they really liked that the grates could lift up for cleaning, they did say that they didn’t like that there were some stains or marks that they couldn’t get off no matter what they tried to do. Overall, they said that they are pretty satisfied with the stovetop, giving it a 5 out of 6, and referenced the knobs as one of the main reasons they couldn’t give it a higher score. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="userRow" style="background:#93A661;">
              <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">User 3</h2>
              <p>User 3 is someone that enjoys cooking (gave it a 5 out of 6) and said that they use the stovetop multiple times a week, using it during the week mostly to cook dinner and then on weekends more to cook lunch. This user felt that the stove always performed as anticipated and having had experience with both gas and electric stoves, they said that they prefer gas stovetops because it is easier to control the heat. In regards to how they pick the burners, they said that they pretty much always start out with the two largest burners and they will only use the back burners if they have to since they commented that they are too small and don’t get hot enough. Even though they typically use the largest burners, speeding up cooking time is not a reason for this and instead explained that some things need more time to cook properly, such as they find that they need to turn the burners down in order to simmer everything right. Some other complaints that the user brought up about the stovetop was in relation to the knobs, as they said they do not like the setup especially because they were left handed, and in terms of the amount of space on the stovetop as they preferred to have a bigger space since they didn’t feel they had enough room when making meals that required really big pots and pans. The user also said that they had lots of experience with using all four main burners at once, particularly during the holidays or when having to make multiple meals at the same time, and said that they were pretty dissatisfied with the stovetop in this situation, again bringing up the complaints about the back burners. They also said that they get easily frustrated when using the four burners at the same time since things can go easily wrong very quickly, which could then completely wreck a meal. Another part of the stove that the user said they had extensive experience with was the middle burner, which they were pretty neutral about it. They said it was beneficial since they could use the skillet on it, but they wished it could be hotter and found that they back heats up more than the front, which then requires him to have to turn the skillet in the middle of making something, such as pancakes, to make it cook more evenly. Though they use the stove multiple times a week, cleaning is not even close to a top priority for this user as they say they rarely clean it after using it. Overall, the user gave the stove a 4 out of 6 in terms of satisfaction, citing the small burners, lack of space, and the middle burner as to why it lost points.</p>

        <h2 style="padding-top: 2%;">Soccer Mom Martha</h2>
        <img src="soccermommarthaempathymap.png" style="width:95%">
        <h5>Soccer Mom Martha is a mother of two teenage boys, Michael and Matthew, and works a full time job. Unlike her husband, she does not enjoy cooking, but since he works evenings, she regularly has to make dinner. </h5>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">The challenges she experiences with the stovetop are related to the placements of the knobs and cooking time. Since the knobs are unlabeled and not in the order that she intuitively expects them to be in, she often starts the wrong burner on accident. Also, because she works a full time job and has to frequently take her children to practice and other functions, she often finds that the stove doesn’t cook things quick enough, which stresses her out. </p>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">Martha is a good representative of stovetop users in general because there are a lot of hard working parents who after long, tiring days at the office have to come home and make dinner for the family. Even if they aren’t taking their kids to soccer practice, people live extremely busy lives and so being able to cook something quick after work is something that a lot of people have to do on a daily basis.</p>
        <h2 style="padding-top: 2%;">Gourmet Gary</h2>
        <img src="gourmetgaryempathymap.png" style="width:95%">
        <h5>Gourmet Gary is a recent college graduate and one of his favorite hobbies is to cook a wide variety of meals for himself and his roommates. He also likes using recipes from social media or cook books to make dishes he has never had before.</h5>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">Gary’s biggest challenges when it comes to the stovetop is related to the quality of the burners and the space available on the stovetop. He finds it difficult to cook with the back burners because they don’t get hot enough and finds it rather difficult to have enough space to do everything he needs to on the stovetop, especially when using all four burners at once.</p>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">Especially while quarantining during the pandemic, cooking and trying lots of different dishes is an interest and something that a lot of people like to do. Therefore, since there are a large number of people who like to cook and try new meals, Gary is a good representative of stovetop users in general.</p>
